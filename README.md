Bus Mall

Building a website that allows users to vote on what products should go in the Bus Mall magazine. This lab was to create a constructor function that has these properties:

1. Name of the product
2. File path of image
3. Times the image has been shown

We were asked to track clicks(votes) of the assorted products and have 25 rounds of voting. At the end of the voting, the user may click a button to see the results in a list.

Reflections and Comments:

- This lab went well! It was helping to have a pretty similar guide to follows along with to help cement this process. I have definitely learned that repetition is key! I need to trust myself that I know the solution, also. There were a couple of times I asked for help and probably could have figured it out on my own. I felt little distracted so this lab took me about 2 hours.

The marketer doesn't want to see the same three photos as a voting option. We had to update our algorithm using .shift to add a variable to the beginning of the array. They also wanted to see the results in a chart.

Followed along during demo, used Goat demo as reference, had some help from Audrey and used Google to find .shift

- Overall this went well! I feel good about building a chart and understand the .shift method. I'm not sure if that what the correct method to use but it worked! I thought this lab was going to take a while to complete but I was able to get through it in around 2 hours.

I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app
